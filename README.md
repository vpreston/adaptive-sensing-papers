> Static phemonena are measured in order to define an underlying functional relationship. A hierarchical model for coarse-to-fine estimates of an observation set is used. The proposed method converges in simulation around 1000+ samples, creating a map that is at least as good as a traditional lawnmower navigation while optimizing for distance, budget, error, etc.
